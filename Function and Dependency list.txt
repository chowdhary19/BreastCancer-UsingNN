The script utilizes the following libraries :-

1. numpy: Used for numerical operations and handling arrays.
2. pandas: Used for data manipulation and handling DataFrames.
3. sklearn.datasets: Specifically, load_breast_cancer from sklearn.datasets to load the breast cancer dataset.
4. sklearn.model_selection: Specifically, train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection for splitting data into training and testing sets.
5. sklearn.preprocessing: Specifically, StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing for feature scaling.
6. sklearn.linear_model: Specifically, LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear_model for building the logistic regression model.
7. sklearn.metrics: Specifically, classification_report and accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics for model evaluation.
